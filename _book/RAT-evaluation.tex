Conclusion

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in
out-hospital-cardiac arrest with a reported incidence of 20--30\%
\citep{voss_how_2014, simons_incidence_2007}. This is of concern since
patients who have suffered an OHCA, are already in extremis. If standard
suctioning techniques are not sufficient to maintain a clear airway and
provide ventilation, then these patients will die, irrespective of the
quality of chest compressions and the timeliness of defibrillation.
Arguably, tracheal intubation is the preferred airway management
technique in patients with ongoing airway contamination, but there is
evidence that this is difficult to achieve when the airway is soiled
\citep{sakles_impact_2017}. Even if patients survive to the hospital, it
is possible that aspiration pneumonias may adversely affect survival
outcome, although this has yet to be proved empirically
\citep{christ_early-onset_2016}.

Traditional suctioning techniques have been criticised, and training in
the management of contaminated airways, limited. This has led to the
development of a combined suction/laryngoscopy technique to facilitate
intubation, known as Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway
Decontamination (SALAD), and the creation of modified airway manikins to
allow for practice in these techniques \citep{ducanto_novel_2017}.

However, to date there has only been one study specifically looking at
the SALAD technique and the outcomes were self-reported confidence
measures of trainees in using the technique. Other techniques have been
described to manage significant airway contamination, including the use
of a meconium aspirator \citep{kei_comparing_2017}, which is not
practical in the out-of-hospital environment (and requires a device that
is not typically carried by UK ambulance services), and deliberate
intubation of the oesophagus (the oesophageal diversion manoeuvre), of
which the sum total of evidence in support of the procedure is a single
case report \citep{kornhall_intentional_2015}.

This study aims to determine whether a short teaching session of the
SALAD technique to paramedics, improves their ability to intubate a
contaminated airway.The primary objective is to determine the difference
between paramedic first-pass intubation success, before and after SALAD
training, in a simulated soiled airway. Secondary objectives are to
determine the difference in time taken to achieve first-pass intubation
success, before and after SALAD training in a simulated soiled airway,
and the effect of multiple intubation attempts on success rates
following SALAD training.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-1}}

\hypertarget{study-design-and-participants}{%
\subsection{Study design and
participants}\label{study-design-and-participants}}

This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Yorkshire Ambulance
Service NHS Trust (YAS). Participants were NHS staff employed by YAS,
who were Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registered
paramedics at the time of enrolment in the study, authorised to intubate
and who had received no SALAD training in the previous 3 months.
Potential participants were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion
criteria, were allergic to the `vomit' ingredients or unwilling to
provide consent to participate.

\hypertarget{randomisation}{%
\subsection{Randomisation}\label{randomisation}}

In order to adjust for changes in participant performance by making
repeated attempts at intubation, paramedics were randomised into either:
making two pre-training intubation attempts and one post-training
attempt (group AAB); or making one pre-training intubation attempt and
two post-training attempts (ABB). Groups were evenly allocated
(i.e.~1:1) using a block randomisation sequence provided by RANDOM.ORG.
To distinguish between the training pathways and number of the assessed
attempts, group AAB's attempts were denoted
A\textsubscript{01}A\textsubscript{02}B\textsubscript{01} and group
ABBs, A\textsubscript{11}B\textsubscript{11}B\textsubscript{12}. It was
not possible to blind participants or the researcher from the group
allocation.

\hypertarget{intervention}{%
\subsection{Intervention}\label{intervention}}

\hypertarget{salad-manikin}{%
\subsubsection{SALAD manikin}\label{salad-manikin}}

A modified TruCorp AirSim Advance airway manikin was used for the study
as it has realistic airway anatomy and can be used for tracheal
intubation training. The oesophagus of this manikin has been connected,
via a hosepipe, to a bilge pump that is sited within a reservoir of
simulated vomit (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}). The vomit is water, coloured
with food-grade colouring, and thickened with xanthan gum (a food
additive). Once the bilge pump is switched on, it can generate a
constant flow of liquid into the oropharynx, obscuring any view of the
laryngeal inlet. The flow rate is controlled by a tap, which was
calibrated to provide 1 L/min of vomit to the oropharynx of the manikin
during intubation attempts. To keep vomit within the oropharynx, the
left and right bronchi on the manikin have been occluded.

Standard intubation equipment, including personal protective equipment
(PPE) and motorised suction, that is routinely used within YAS was
provided for participants, and the study researcher acted as a competent
assistant for the intubation attempts.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7in]{images/figure-1} \caption{SALAD manikin setup used for the study}\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Once informed consent was obtained, paramedics were randomised into
either group AAB or ABB. All attempts utilised direct laryngoscopy,
which is the standard intubation technique within YAS. Prior to each
intubation attempt, the manikin was primed with vomit to ensure the same
level of oropharyngeal obstruction. All attempts were video recorded for
timing accuracy.

Participants were deemed to have begun their attempt once the bilge pump
was turned on. The attempt will be considered over when either: the
paramedic intubates the manikin and verbally confirms with the
researcher that the attempt has been completed or; 90 seconds has
elapsed or; the tracheal tube is placed into the oesophagus and the cuff
is inflated while the pump is still running.

If the tracheal tube was not in the trachea, with the cuff inflated and
connected to a bag-valve device within 90 seconds, the attempt was
considered a failure.

Participants randomised into the two pre-training attempts group (AAB)
made their second intubation attempt immediately following the first,
and prior to the group training session. Once all participants completed
their pre-training intubation attempt(s), the training session was
delivered. The training intervention adopted the Advanced Life Support
Group/Resuscitation Council 4-stage approach of skills teaching,
comprising \citep{bullock_pocket_2008}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A real-time demonstration of the SALAD technique by the researcher
\item
  A repeated demonstration with an explanation of the rationale of the
  steps taken when performing SALAD (not real-time)
\item
  Another demonstration of the SALAD technique conducted by the
  researcher, but guided by one of the participants
\item
  An attempt by the same participant who guided the researcher in the
  previous step, followed by a practice attempt by the other
  participants.
\end{enumerate}

Following the training session, participants made their post-training
intubation attempt(s) conducted using the same method as for the
pre-training intubation attempt(s). Participants randomised into the two
post-training attempts (ABB), made their second attempt immediately
following the first post-training attempt.

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

The primary outcome is the difference in proportions of paramedic
first-pass intubation success, before and after SALAD training The
secondary outcomes are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mean of the differences in intubation attempt times, between first and
  second intubation attempts, and between pre- and post-training
  attempts
\item
  Difference in success rates between participants who have two
  post-training intubation attempts versus participants who only have
  one post-training intubation attempt.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

\hypertarget{sample-size}{%
\subsection{Sample size}\label{sample-size}}

A sample size of 154 participants was calculated to be required to
determine a change in the proportion of intubation success, from 0.25 in
the pre-training group, to 0.50 in post-training group, with a power
(1-\(\beta\)) of 90\% and a significance level (\(\alpha\)) of 5\%.
Given that there is no literature to guide expected performance, a
conservative estimate was made in consultation with an internationally
recognised SALAD expert, Dr.~James DuCanto (J.DuCanto, personal
communication, April 26, 2018).

\hypertarget{primary-outcome-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Primary outcome
analysis}\label{primary-outcome-analysis}}

To determine if the training has an effect and increases the success
rate of intubation, the proportions of success in the groups who
received no training before their 2nd intubation attempt
(A\textsubscript{02}) was compared to those who did receive training
before their 2nd intubation attempt (B\textsubscript{11}). Comparing the
rates at these time points, controls for any learning effect due to
participants making more than one attempt at intubation. The difference
in the two proportions was analysed using a two independent samples
proportion z-test, assuming a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5\%.

\hypertarget{secondary-outcome-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Secondary outcome
analysis}\label{secondary-outcome-analysis}}

Intubation times were truncated at 90 seconds. The mean of the
differences (A\textsubscript{01} -- A\textsubscript{02}) were compared
with the mean of differences (A\textsubscript{11} --
B\textsubscript{11}). The mean of the differences seen at the final
measurements, (A\textsubscript{01} -- B\textsubscript{01}) were compared
to (A\textsubscript{11} -- B\textsubscript{12}), to see if there were
any differences between the two pathways, which might suggest that
practice following the training, further improves the time to successful
intubation. In addition, success rates between B\textsubscript{01} and
B\textsubscript{12} attempts were compared to see whether practice
following training improved intubation success rate. A Student's t-test
was utilised to test for the differences between mean pre- and
post-training intubation attempt times, and a two independent samples
proportion z-test to test the difference in success rates.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\section{Results}\label{results-1}}

164 participants took part in SATIATED, with an equal number in groups
AAB and ABB. The groups were similar with respect to intubation attempts
(successful or not) undertaken in the previous 12 months. The median
number of years as a paramedic was 1.5 years less in group ABB, although
the interquartile range was similar. 36 participants had heard of the
SALAD technique prior to the study, with a slightly higher number in
group ABB (Table \ref{tab:demoTable}).
