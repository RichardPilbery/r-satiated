\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in
out-hospital-cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a reported incidence of
20--30\%. This is of concern since patients who have suffered an OHCA
are already in extremis. If standard suctioning techniques are not
sufficient to maintain a clear airway and provide ventilation, then
these patients will die, irrespective of the quality of chest
compressions and the timeliness of defibrillation. This study aimed to
determine whether a short teaching session of the Suction Assisted
Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination (SALAD) technique, improved
paramedics' ability to successfully intubate a contaminated airway.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsubsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

A modified airway manikin with the oesophagus connected to a reservoir
of `vomit', and a bilge pump capable of propelling the vomit up into the
oropharynx, was used to simulate a soiled airway. The intervention
consisted of a brief SALAD training session with a demonstration and
opportunity to practice. Participants were randomly allocated into two
groups: AAB who made two pre-training intubation attempts and one
post-training attempt, and ABB, who made one pre-training and two
post-training attempts, to adjust for improvement in performance due to
repetition.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}}

In this manikin study, following a brief SALAD training session, more
paramedics were able to intubate a soiled airway on their first attempt,
compared to those without training (90.2\% vs 53.7\%, difference of
36.6\%, 95\%CI 24--49.1\%, p\textless{}0.001). In addition, the mean
difference in time taken to perform a successful intubation between
groups was statistically significant for attempts 1 and 2 (mean
difference 11.71 seconds, 95\% CI 1.95-- 21.47 seconds, p=0.02), but not
attempts 1 and 3 (mean difference -2.52 seconds, 95\% CI -11.64--6.61
seconds, p=0.58)). This result is likely to be confounded by the use of
tracheal suction, which only occurred in the post-training attempts, and
added additional time to the intubation attempts. There was no
statistically significant difference in success rates on the third
attempt between AAB and ABB (89.0\% vs 86.6\%, difference 2.4\%, 95\%CI
7.6--12.4\%, p=0.63).

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In this study, the use of the SALAD technique significantly improved
first attempt success rates when paramedics were intubating a simulated
soiled airway.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in
out-hospital-cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a reported incidence of 20--30\%
\citep{benger_effect_2018, voss_how_2014, simons_incidence_2007}. This
is of concern since patients who have suffered an OHCA, are already in
extremis and there is limited evidence that the presence of emesis leads
to a reduction in odds of survival \citep{simons_incidence_2007}. If
standard suctioning techniques are not sufficient to maintain a clear
airway and provide ventilation, then these patients will die,
irrespective of the quality of chest compressions and the timeliness of
defibrillation. Arguably, tracheal intubation is the preferred airway
management technique in patients with ongoing airway contamination, but
there is evidence that this is difficult to achieve when the airway is
soiled \citep{sakles_impact_2017}. Early intubation may also help
prevent aspiration pneumonias which are thought to adversely affect
survival outcome, although this has yet to be proved empirically
\citep{christ_early-onset_2016}.

Traditional suctioning techniques have been criticised, and paramedic
training in the management of contaminated airways, limited. This has
led to the development of a combined suction/laryngoscopy technique to
facilitate intubation, known as Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway
Decontamination (SALAD), and the creation of modified airway manikins to
allow for practice in these techniques \citep{ducanto_novel_2017}.

However, to date there has only been one study specifically looking at
the SALAD technique and the outcomes were limited to self-reported
confidence measures of trainees using the technique. Other techniques
have been described to manage significant airway contamination,
including the use of a meconium aspirator \citep{kei_comparing_2017},
which requires a device that is not typically carried by UK ambulance
services, and deliberate intubation of the oesophagus (the oesophageal
diversion manoeuvre), of which the sum total of evidence in support of
the procedure is a single case report \citep{kornhall_intentional_2015}.

This study aimed to determine whether a short teaching session of the
SALAD technique to paramedics, improved their ability to successfully
intubate a contaminated airway. The primary objective was to determine
the difference between paramedic first-pass intubation success, before
and after SALAD training, in a simulated soiled airway. The secondary
objective was to determine the difference in time taken to achieve
first-pass intubation success, before and after SALAD training in a
simulated soiled airway, since it was hypothesised that the time to
successful intubation might improve as a result of repeated attempts at
intubation i.e.~be due to a practice effect, rather than the SALAD
technique alone.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-1}}

\hypertarget{study-design-and-participants}{%
\subsection{Study design and
participants}\label{study-design-and-participants}}

This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Yorkshire Ambulance
Service NHS Trust (YAS) between August and December, 2018. Participants
were NHS staff employed by YAS, who were Health and Care Professions
Council (HCPC) registered paramedics at the time of enrolment in the
study, authorised to intubate and who had received no SALAD training in
the previous three months. Potential participants were excluded if they
did not meet the inclusion criteria, were allergic to the `vomit'
ingredients or unwilling to provide consent to participate.

\hypertarget{randomisation}{%
\subsection{Randomisation}\label{randomisation}}

In order to adjust for improvements in participant performance that
might arise from repeated attempts at intubation, beyond that of the
SALAD training itself, paramedics were randomised into either: making
two pre-training intubation attempts and one post-training attempt
(group AAB); or making one pre-training intubation attempt and two
post-training attempts (ABB). Groups were evenly allocated (i.e.~1:1)
using a block randomisation sequence provided by RANDOM.ORG. To
distinguish between the training pathways and number of the assessed
attempts, group AAB's attempts were denoted
A\textsubscript{01}A\textsubscript{02}B\textsubscript{01} and group
ABBs, A\textsubscript{11}B\textsubscript{11}B\textsubscript{12}. It was
not possible to blind participants or the researcher from the group
allocation.

\hypertarget{intervention}{%
\subsection{Intervention}\label{intervention}}

\hypertarget{salad-manikin}{%
\subsubsection{SALAD manikin}\label{salad-manikin}}

A modified TruCorp AirSim Advance airway manikin was used for the study
as it has realistic airway anatomy and can be used for tracheal
intubation training \citep{yang_comparison_2010}. The oesophagus of this
manikin was connected, via a hosepipe, to a bilge pump sited within a
reservoir of simulated vomit (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}). The vomit was
water, coloured with food-grade colouring, and thickened with xanthan
gum (a food additive). While there are recipes for solid-containing
vomit, it was decided that as a first introduction to the technique,
thickened opaque vomit would present a sufficient challenge. Once the
bilge pump was switched on, a constant flow of vomit was propelled into
the oropharynx, obscuring any view of the laryngeal inlet. The flow rate
was controlled by a tap, which was calibrated to provide 1 L/min of
vomit to the oropharynx of the manikin during intubation attempts. To
keep vomit within the oropharynx, the left and right bronchi on the
manikin were occluded.

Standard intubation equipment, including personal protective equipment
(PPE) and motorised suction routinely used within YAS, was provided for
participants, and the study researcher acted as a competent assistant
for the intubation attempts.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7in]{images/figure-1} \caption{SALAD manikin setup used for the study}\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Once informed consent was obtained, paramedics were randomised into
either group AAB or ABB. All attempts utilised direct laryngoscopy,
which is the standard intubation technique within YAS. Prior to each
intubation attempt, the manikin was primed with vomit to ensure the same
level of oropharyngeal obstruction. All attempts were video recorded for
timing accuracy.

Participants were deemed to have commenced their attempt once the bilge
pump was turned on. The attempt was considered to be over when either:
the paramedic intubated the manikin and verbally confirmed with the
researcher that the attempt had been completed or; 90 seconds had
elapsed or; the tracheal tube was placed into the oesophagus and the
cuff inflated while the pump was still running.

If the tracheal tube was not in the trachea, with the cuff inflated and
connected to a bag-valve device within 90 seconds, the attempt was
considered a failure. While it is generally advocated that intubation
attempts should take no longer than 30 seconds, this assumes that it is
possible to pre-oxygenate patients before an intubation attempt, and
re-oxygenate them in the event that intubation is not possible. In
patients who have an oropharynx full of vomit, oxygenation is not
possible. Therefore a pragmatic and prolonged target of 90 seconds was
suggested by Dr.~DuCanto (J.DuCanto, personal communication, April 26,
2018).

Participants randomised into the two pre-training attempts group (AAB)
made their second intubation attempt immediately following the first,
and prior to the group training session. Once all participants completed
their pre-training intubation attempt(s), the training session was
delivered. The training intervention adopted the Advanced Life Support
Group/Resuscitation Council 4-stage approach of skills teaching,
comprising \citep{bullock_pocket_2008}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A real-time demonstration of the SALAD technique by the researcher
\item
  A repeated demonstration with an explanation of the rationale of the
  steps taken when performing SALAD (not real-time)
\item
  Another demonstration of the SALAD technique conducted by the
  researcher, but guided by one of the participants
\item
  An attempt by the same participant who guided the researcher in the
  previous step, followed by a practice attempt by the other
  participants.
\end{enumerate}

Following the training session, participants made their post-training
intubation attempt(s) conducted using the same method as for the
pre-training intubation attempt(s). Participants randomised into the two
post-training attempts (ABB), made their second attempt immediately
following the first post-training attempt.

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

The primary outcome was the difference in proportions of paramedic
first-pass intubation success rates, before and after SALAD training.

The secondary outcomes were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mean of the differences between groups AAB and ABB with respect to the
  first and second successful intubation attempt times, and between the
  first and third successful intubation attempt times, in order to
  detect improvements in time to successful intubation
\item
  Difference in success rates between participants who have two
  post-training intubation attempts (ABB) versus participants who only
  have one post-training intubation attempt (AAB).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

\hypertarget{sample-size}{%
\subsection{Sample size}\label{sample-size}}

A sample size of 154 participants was calculated to be required to
detect a change in the proportion of intubation successes, from 0.25 in
the pre-training group, to 0.50 in post-training group, with a power
(1-\(\beta\)) of 90\% and a significance level (\(\alpha\)) of 5\%.
Given that there is no literature to guide expected performance, a
conservative estimate was made in consultation with an internationally
recognised SALAD expert, Dr.~James DuCanto (J.DuCanto, personal
communication, April 26, 2018).

\hypertarget{primary-outcome-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Primary outcome
analysis}\label{primary-outcome-analysis}}

To determine if the training had an effect and increased the success
rate of intubation, the proportions of success in the groups who
received no training before their 2nd intubation attempt
(A\textsubscript{02}) was compared to those who did receive training
before their 2nd intubation attempt (B\textsubscript{11}). Comparing the
rates at these time points, controlled for any learning effect due to
participants making more than one attempt at intubation. The difference
in the two proportions was analysed using a two independent samples
proportion z-test, assuming a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5\%.

\hypertarget{secondary-outcome-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Secondary outcome
analysis}\label{secondary-outcome-analysis}}

Only successful intubation attempts and their timings were included in
the secondary outcome analysis. It was hypothesised that time to
successful intubation might improve as a result of repeated attempts at
intubation i.e.~be due to a practice effect, rather than the SALAD
technique alone. Therefore, the mean of the attempt time differences
(A\textsubscript{01} -- A\textsubscript{02}) were compared with the mean
of attempt time differences (A\textsubscript{11} --
B\textsubscript{11}). In addition, the mean of the attempt time
differences seen at the final measurements, (A\textsubscript{01} --
B\textsubscript{01}) were compared to the mean of the attempt time
differences (A\textsubscript{11} -- B\textsubscript{12}). Finally,
success rates between B\textsubscript{01} and B\textsubscript{12}
attempts were compared to see whether practice following training
improved the intubation success rate. A Student's t-test was utilised to
test for the differences between mean pre- and post-training intubation
attempt times, and a two independent samples proportion z-test to test
the difference in success rates.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\section{Results}\label{results-1}}

164 participants took part in SATIATED, with an equal number in groups
AAB and ABB. The groups were similar with respect to intubation attempts
(successful or not) undertaken in the previous 12 months. The median
number of years as a paramedic was 1.5 years less in group ABB, although
the interquartile range was similar. 36 participants had heard of the
SALAD technique prior to the study, with a slightly higher number in
group ABB (Table \ref{tab:demoTable}).

To determine the mean difference in time to successful intubation, a

intubating on attempts 1 and 2, and attempts 1 and 3, was examined.
There was a statistically significant difference between groups AAB

to perform a successful intubation on attempts 1 and 2 (mean difference
11.71 seconds, 95\% CI 1.95--21.47 seconds, p=0.02). There was no
significant difference between groups AAB (n=27) and ABB (n=27) with
respect to mean difference in time taken to perform a successful
intubation on attempts 1 and 3 (mean difference -2.52 seconds, 95\% CI
-11.64--6.61 seconds, p=0.58)). Summary values for the mean differences
are shown in Table \ref{tab:lotsmeans}. Finally, there was no

A number of techniques were utilised by participants to facillitate
intubation (Figure \ref{fig:techniqueBarchart}). This included asking
the assistant to hold the suction catheter in the mouth (n=35), and
leaving with the suction in the mouth (although without occluding the
suction vent hole, n=20). In addition, there were also instances where
participants did not use a bougie (n=48, of which 21 were successful
attempts, and 27 unsucessful) and forgot to occlude the suction vent
hole on the catheter when attempting to clear the airway themselves
(n=35).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In this manikin study, following a brief SALAD training session, more
paramedics were able to intubate a soiled airway on their first attempt,
compared to those without training (90.2\% vs 53.7\%, difference of
36.6\%, 95\%CI 24--49.1\%, p\textless{}0.001). In addition, the mean
difference in time taken to perform a successful intubation between
groups was statistically significant for on attempts 1 and 2 (mean
difference 11.71 seconds, 95\% CI 1.95-- 21.47 seconds, p=0.02), but not
attempts 1 and 3 (mean difference -2.52 seconds, 95\% CI -11.64--6.61
seconds, p=0.58)). There was no statistically significant difference in
success rates on the third attempt between AAB and ABB (89.0\% vs
86.6\%, difference 2.4\%, 95\%CI 7.6--12.4\%, p=0.63).

\hypertarget{salad}{%
\subsection{SALAD}\label{salad}}

While evolution of the SALAD technqiue has occured as knowledge of the
technique has spread, the essential principles as described by Dr.~Jim
DuCanto remain the same \citep{ducanto_novel_2017}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Correct positioning of the patient for intubation success
  (e.g.~external auditory meatus level with sternal notch)
\item
  Holding the suction catheter (wide-bore, rigid) in a clenched-fisted
  right hand, with the distal end of the catheter pointing caudad and
  posterior, to enable manipulation of the tongue and mandible as
  required
\item
  Leading with suction to enable identification of relevant anatomical
  structure (posterior portion of tongue, epiglottis, vallecular and
  laryngeal outlet) and following with the laryngoscope (particularly
  important with video laryngoscopes to avoid contaminating the optics)
\item
  Once the laryngoscope is in the vallecular and a view of the laryngeal
  inlet has been obtained, the suction catheter is `parked' in the top
  of the oesophagus to provide continuous suction during the remainder
  of the intubation attempt
\item
  In order to facilitate placement of the tracheal tube, the suction
  catheter is moved across to the left-side of the mouth, ensuring that
  the tip remains in the oesophagus. This can be achieved by either
  sliding the catheter under the laryngoscope blade, or by briefly
  removing the catheter and inserting it to the left of the laryngoscope
  blade
\item
  Intubate as normal, with or without a bougie
\item
  Inflate the cuff on the tracheal tube to prevent further contamination
  of the lower airway
\item
  Suction down the tracheal tube with a flexible suction catheter prior
  to ventilation.
\end{enumerate}

The last step in this process typically takes 7--10 seconds to complete,
a fact that was overlooked during the design of this study as it has
likely confounded the mean timing differences aimed at identification
learning that occurred from multiple attempts. None of the pre-training
attempts finished with post-intubation suction, whereas 100\% of the
post-training attempts did. Successful intubations in group AAB did show
timing improvements between attempts 1 and 2, but the delay in
intubation completion in the latter attempts might explain why there
appears to be no significant difference between attempts 1 and 3.

\subsection{Suction catheters}\label{suction-catheters}}

The suction catheters used by YAS (Pennine Healthcare Link Yankauer 22ch
with 6mm internal diameter tubing) have an internal diameter of
approximately 6mm and include a vent hole. For this study, the vent hole
was occluded by tape for the training and post-training attempts.
Failure to occlude the vent hole did occur on occasion during some
attempts, and this has been reported elsewhere.
\citet{cox_yankauer_2017} conducted a simulated soiled airway study with
37 emergency medicine residents, and found that 76\% did not occlude the
vent hole immediately on suctioning, with 60\% having to be prompted to
do so after 20 seconds. Catheters are available which do not contain a
vent hole, which may make them more suitable for emergency situations.

Occluding the vent hole also presented a challenge for participants who
left the suction in situ while continuing with an intubation attempt.
While this strategy did make it easier to recommence suction when the
vent hole was re-occluded by the participant, for the remainder of the
attempt, the suction catheter restricted the view of the oropharynx. One
alternative strategy that some participants did use, was to utilise the
assistant to hold the suction in the oropharynx, thus maintaining
continuous suction.

\hypertarget{bougies}{%
\subsection{Bougies}\label{bougies}}

The Trust mandates the use of bougies as part of the intubation standard
operating procedure. Bougies have been associated with improved
first-pass intubation success
\citep{kingma_comparison_2017, driver_bougie_2017} in other studies. In
YAS, paramedics are generally taught to `railroad' the tracheal tube
following successful bougie insertion through the vocal cords. Stylets
are not used. In this study, 48/492 (9.8\%) of attempts did not utilise
a bougie. This may indicate a training need, since few attempts omitted
using a bougie following the SALAD training. There is a possibility that
this oversight may have affected the results of the study. However, in
group AAB, more participants who made a successful second intubation
attempt did not use a bougie than those who were unsuccessful (8/44,
(18.2\%) vs 6/38, (15.8\%) respectively).

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

This was a manikin study and as such, does not reflect clinical
practice. For paramedics, most intubations they attempt will be at floor
level and occur during a cardiac arrest, which is likely to result in
some head and neck movement. The intubation attempts in the study by
contrast were conducted on a static manikin at table height. In
addition, the manikin could not be moved, so alternative positioning
such as lateral head movement, or placing the patient in a Tredelenburg
position, was not possible.

While the study did use a thickened and opaque liquid as the vomit, it
did not contain any solid material, and was not as odorous as real
vomit.

Finally, it was not possible to blind participants from their
allocation, although they did not know that the second attempt was to be
used to calculate the primary outcome. However, the researcher, acting
as competent assistant did, and this may have inadvertently led to bias.
In addition, for the post-training intubation attempts, it is also
possible that the researcher was too proactive in assisting with
suctioning down the tube at the end of the attempt, resulting in 100\%
of post-training attempts receiving tracheal suction.

\hypertarget{conclusion-1}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}}

In this manikin study, following a brief training session, paramedics
were able to intubate a soiled airway on their first attempt,
significantly more often when using the SALAD technique.
