	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies have suggested that emesis may occur in up to a third of cardiac arrest patients. The goal of this investigation was to characterize the frequency, timing, and outcome association of emesis in persons suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in order to understand the role and care-implications of emesis better.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of persons 18 years and over suffering non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who received attempted resuscitation by paramedics in the study community from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 (n=1009). The presence and timing of emesis were determined by paramedics and recorded on the Emergency Medical Services report form. We used logistic regression analyses to assess whether emesis was independently associated with survival to hospital discharge.
RESULTS: The presence or absence of emesis was documented in 76\% (1009/1333) of cases. Emesis was present in 32\% (318/1009). Two-thirds (208/312) of emesis occurred prior to EMS arrival; 28\% (88/312) of episodes occurred between EMT arrival and intubation; and 4\% (13/312) occurred after intubation. After adjustment for potential confounders, the presence of emesis was associated with a decreased odds of survival to hospital discharge among all-rhythm arrest (Odds ratio (OR)=0.50 [0.28-0.89]) and ventricular fibrillation arrest (OR=0.52 [0.27-0.98]).
CONCLUSION: Given the frequency of emesis, the potential that some portion of emesis may be related to care, and the adverse association between emesis and survival, approaches that treat or prevent emesis better may improve the chances of survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {Background: The objective was to determine the impact of a soiled airway on ﬁrstpass success when using the GlideScope video laryngoscope or the direct laryngoscope for intubation in the emergency department (ED).
Methods: Data were prospectively collected on all patients intubated in an academic ED from July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2016. Patients ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent rapid sequence intubation by an emergency medicine resident with the GlideScope or the direct laryngoscope, were included in the analysis. Data were stratiﬁed by device used (GlideScope or direct laryngoscope). The primary outcome was ﬁrstpass success. Patients were categorized as those without blood or vomitus (CLEAN) and those with blood or vomitus (SOILED) in their airway. Multivariate regression models were developed to control for confounders.
Results: When using the GlideScope, the ﬁrstpass success was lower in the SOILED group (249/306; 81.4\%) than the in CLEAN group (586/644, 91.0\%; difference = 9.6\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 4.7\%–14.5\%). Similarly, when using the direct laryngoscope, the ﬁrstpass success was lower in the SOILED group (186/284, 65.5\%) than in the CLEAN group (569/751, 75.8\%; difference = 10.3\%; 95\% CI = 4.0\%–16.6\%). The SOILED airway was associated with a decreased ﬁrstpass success in both the GlideScope cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.4; 95\% CI = 0.3–0.7) and the direct laryngoscope cohort (aOR = 0.6; 95\% CI = 0.5–0.8).
Conclusion: Soiling of the airway was associated with a reduced ﬁrstpass success during emergency intubation, and this reduction occurred to a similar degree whether using either the GlideScope or the direct laryngoscope.},

We determined the association between bougie use and ﬁrst-pass intubation success, adjusting for neuromuscular blockade, video laryngoscopy, abnormal airway anatomy, and whether the patient was placed in the snifﬁng position or the head was lifted off the bed during intubation.
Results: Intubation with a Macintosh blade was attempted in 543 cases; a bougie was used on the majority of initial attempts (80\%; n¼435). First-pass success was greater with than without bougie use (95\% versus 86\%; absolute difference 9\% [95\% conﬁdence interval \{CI\} 2\% to 16\%]). The median ﬁrst-attempt duration was higher with than without bougie (40 versus 27 seconds; difference 14 seconds [95\% CI 11 to 16 seconds]).

	abstract = {Background
It has been suggested that an adult 8.0 endotracheal tube (ETT) connected to a neonatal meconium aspirator would improve suctioning during emergent endotracheal intubation compared to the Yankauer suction instrument, the standard tool used by emergency physicians.
Objectives
This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of a Yankauer vs. an ETT-meconium aspirator set-up in suctioning liquids of different viscosities.
Methods
The Yankauer and ETT-meconium aspirator device underwent a head-to-head timed comparison, suctioning 250 mL of three different fluids, varying in viscosity. The first comparison test used tap water to represent simple oral secretions. The second comparison test used porcine whole blood as a proxy for human blood. The third comparison test used a coarsely blended mixture of a hamburger, French fries, and a soda to simulate emesis from a recently ingested meal. Five separate time trials were conducted for each liquid and for each suction device.
Results
The ETT-meconium aspirator device compared to the Yankauer suctioned faster in both the water comparison test (mean = 2.6 s vs. 3.4 s; p {\textless} 0.001) and the porcine whole blood comparison test (mean = 2.9 s vs. 4.3 s; p = 0.0015). In the emesis trial, the Yankauer immediately clogged, whereas the ETT-meconium aspirator apparatus managed to suction an average of 90 mL prior to clogging.
Conclusion
Compared to the Yankauer, an adult 8.0 ETT connected to a meconium aspirator was superior in suctioning liquids of varying viscosities and should be considered when encountering a difficult airway due to copious secretions, blood, or emesis.},

	abstract = {Background
More than half of all non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients die in the hospital. Early-onset pneumonia (EOP) has been described as one of the most common complications after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the expanded use of alternative airway devices (AAD) might influence the incidence of EOP following OHCA.

Material/Methods
We analyzed data from all OHCA patients admitted to our hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. EOP was defined as proof of the presence of a pathogenic microorganism in samples of respiratory secretions within the first 5 days after hospital admission.

Results
There were 252 patients admitted: 155 men (61.5\%) and 97 women (38.5\%), with a mean age of 69.1±13.8 years. Of these, 164 patients (77.6\%) were admitted with an endotracheal tube (ET) and 62 (27.4\%) with an AAD. We found that 36 out of a total of 80 respiratory secretion samples (45.0\%) contained pathogenic microorganisms, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common bacteria. Neither bacterial detection (p=0.765) nor survival rates (p=0.538) differed between patients admitted with ET and those with AAD.

Conclusions
Irrespective of increasing use of AAD, the incidence of EOP remains high.},

	abstract = {Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a reported incidence of 20–30\%. Arguably, tracheal intubation is the preferred airway management technique in patients with ongoing airway contamination, but there is evidence that this is difficult to achieve when the airway is soiled. In addition, traditional suctioning techniques have been criticised, and training in the management of contaminated airways is limited. If standard suctioning techniques are not sufficient to maintain a clear airway and provide ventilation, then these patients will die, irrespective of the quality of chest compressions and the timeliness of defibrillation. This has led to the development of a combined suction/laryngoscopy technique to facilitate intubation, known as Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination, and the creation of modified airway manikins to allow for practice in these techniques. However, to date there has only been one study specifically looking at the Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination technique, and the outcomes were self-reported confidence measures of trainees in using the technique.},

In the SGA group, 311 of 4882 patients (6.4\%) had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) vs 300 of 4407 patients (6.8\%) in the TI group (adjusted risk difference [RD], −0.6\% [95\% CI, −1.6\% to 0.4\%]).

Patients were included if they were enrolled in the usual practice arm of the study, fulfilled the main study eligibility criteria and did not receive either of the intervention supraglottic airway devices during the resuscitation attempt.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Data from 196 attempted resuscitations were included in the analysis. The initial approach to airway management was bag-mask for 108 (55\%), a supraglottic airway device (SAD) for 39 (20\%) and tracheal intubation for 49 (25\%). Paramedics made further airway interventions in 64\% of resuscitations. When intubation was the initial approach, there was no further intervention in 76\% of cases; this compares to 16\% and 44\% with bag-mask and SAD respectively. The most common reason cited by paramedics for changing from bag-mask was to carry out advanced life support, followed by regurgitation and inadequate ventilation. Inadequate ventilation was the commonest reason cited for removing a SAD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Paramedics use a range of techniques to manage the airway during OHCA, and as the resuscitation evolves. It is therefore desirable to ensure that a range of techniques and equipment, supported by effective training, are available to paramedics who attend OHCA.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective: To compare the acceptability and preference between manikin models and fresh frozen cadaver (FFC) for direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation training.
Methods: In this prospective crossover trial, participants in the airway workshop performed direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation on four airway training manikins: Airway Management Trainer (Ambu, St Ives, UK), Airway Trainer (Laerdal, Medical, Stavanger, Norway), Airsim (Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) and ‘‘Bill 1’’ (VBM, Sulz, Germany), and FFC. Participants were asked to access the following: reality of jaw mobility, difficulty with mouth opening, reality of neck flexibility, difficulty with intubation, overall model reality and model preference for each model using a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0–10 cm. The VAS scores for each model were compared.
Results: Fifty-six participants were included in the study. The FFC had a highest VAS score for reality of jaw mobility, overall reality and preference of model. Trucorp manikin and Laerdal manikin followed cadaver. There were no significant statistical differences between Trucorp manikin and Laerdal manikin. In difficulty with mouth opening and difficulty with intubation, Trucorp manikin had the lowest VAS score.
Conclusion: The FFC is a more realistic and preferred model for direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation training. Trucorp and Laerdal manikin can be used as alternative models.},
