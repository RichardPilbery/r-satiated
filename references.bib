	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies have suggested that emesis may occur in up to a third of cardiac arrest patients. The goal of this investigation was to characterize the frequency, timing, and outcome association of emesis in persons suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in order to understand the role and care-implications of emesis better.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of persons 18 years and over suffering non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who received attempted resuscitation by paramedics in the study community from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 (n=1009). The presence and timing of emesis were determined by paramedics and recorded on the Emergency Medical Services report form. We used logistic regression analyses to assess whether emesis was independently associated with survival to hospital discharge.
RESULTS: The presence or absence of emesis was documented in 76\% (1009/1333) of cases. Emesis was present in 32\% (318/1009). Two-thirds (208/312) of emesis occurred prior to EMS arrival; 28\% (88/312) of episodes occurred between EMT arrival and intubation; and 4\% (13/312) occurred after intubation. After adjustment for potential confounders, the presence of emesis was associated with a decreased odds of survival to hospital discharge among all-rhythm arrest (Odds ratio (OR)=0.50 [0.28-0.89]) and ventricular fibrillation arrest (OR=0.52 [0.27-0.98]).
CONCLUSION: Given the frequency of emesis, the potential that some portion of emesis may be related to care, and the adverse association between emesis and survival, approaches that treat or prevent emesis better may improve the chances of survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {Background: The objective was to determine the impact of a soiled airway on ﬁrstpass success when using the GlideScope video laryngoscope or the direct laryngoscope for intubation in the emergency department (ED).
Methods: Data were prospectively collected on all patients intubated in an academic ED from July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2016. Patients ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent rapid sequence intubation by an emergency medicine resident with the GlideScope or the direct laryngoscope, were included in the analysis. Data were stratiﬁed by device used (GlideScope or direct laryngoscope). The primary outcome was ﬁrstpass success. Patients were categorized as those without blood or vomitus (CLEAN) and those with blood or vomitus (SOILED) in their airway. Multivariate regression models were developed to control for confounders.
Results: When using the GlideScope, the ﬁrstpass success was lower in the SOILED group (249/306; 81.4\%) than the in CLEAN group (586/644, 91.0\%; difference = 9.6\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 4.7\%–14.5\%). Similarly, when using the direct laryngoscope, the ﬁrstpass success was lower in the SOILED group (186/284, 65.5\%) than in the CLEAN group (569/751, 75.8\%; difference = 10.3\%; 95\% CI = 4.0\%–16.6\%). The SOILED airway was associated with a decreased ﬁrstpass success in both the GlideScope cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.4; 95\% CI = 0.3–0.7) and the direct laryngoscope cohort (aOR = 0.6; 95\% CI = 0.5–0.8).
Conclusion: Soiling of the airway was associated with a reduced ﬁrstpass success during emergency intubation, and this reduction occurred to a similar degree whether using either the GlideScope or the direct laryngoscope.},

	abstract = {Background
More than half of all non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients die in the hospital. Early-onset pneumonia (EOP) has been described as one of the most common complications after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the expanded use of alternative airway devices (AAD) might influence the incidence of EOP following OHCA.

Material/Methods
We analyzed data from all OHCA patients admitted to our hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. EOP was defined as proof of the presence of a pathogenic microorganism in samples of respiratory secretions within the first 5 days after hospital admission.

Results
There were 252 patients admitted: 155 men (61.5\%) and 97 women (38.5\%), with a mean age of 69.1±13.8 years. Of these, 164 patients (77.6\%) were admitted with an endotracheal tube (ET) and 62 (27.4\%) with an AAD. We found that 36 out of a total of 80 respiratory secretion samples (45.0\%) contained pathogenic microorganisms, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common bacteria. Neither bacterial detection (p=0.765) nor survival rates (p=0.538) differed between patients admitted with ET and those with AAD.

Conclusions
Irrespective of increasing use of AAD, the incidence of EOP remains high.},

	abstract = {Background
It has been suggested that an adult 8.0 endotracheal tube (ETT) connected to a neonatal meconium aspirator would improve suctioning during emergent endotracheal intubation compared to the Yankauer suction instrument, the standard tool used by emergency physicians.
Objectives
This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of a Yankauer vs. an ETT-meconium aspirator set-up in suctioning liquids of different viscosities.
Methods
The Yankauer and ETT-meconium aspirator device underwent a head-to-head timed comparison, suctioning 250 mL of three different fluids, varying in viscosity. The first comparison test used tap water to represent simple oral secretions. The second comparison test used porcine whole blood as a proxy for human blood. The third comparison test used a coarsely blended mixture of a hamburger, French fries, and a soda to simulate emesis from a recently ingested meal. Five separate time trials were conducted for each liquid and for each suction device.
Results
The ETT-meconium aspirator device compared to the Yankauer suctioned faster in both the water comparison test (mean = 2.6 s vs. 3.4 s; p {\textless} 0.001) and the porcine whole blood comparison test (mean = 2.9 s vs. 4.3 s; p = 0.0015). In the emesis trial, the Yankauer immediately clogged, whereas the ETT-meconium aspirator apparatus managed to suction an average of 90 mL prior to clogging.
Conclusion
Compared to the Yankauer, an adult 8.0 ETT connected to a meconium aspirator was superior in suctioning liquids of varying viscosities and should be considered when encountering a difficult airway due to copious secretions, blood, or emesis.},

	abstract = {Background
Pre-hospital basic airway interventions can be ineffective at providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation in some severely ill or injured patients, and advanced airway interventions are then required. Controversy exists regarding the level of provider required to perform successful pre-hospital intubation. A previous meta-analysis reported pre-hospital intubation success rates of 0.849 for non-physicians versus 0.991 for physicians. The evidence base on the topic has expanded significantly in the last 10 years. This study systematically reviewed recent literature and presents comprehensive data on intubation success rates.

Methods
A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed using PRISMA methodology to identify articles on pre-hospital tracheal intubation published between 2006 and 2016. Overall success rates were estimated using random effects meta-analysis. The relationship between intubation success rate and provider type was assessed in weighted linear regression analysis.

Results
Of the 1838 identified studies, 38 met the study inclusion criteria. Intubation was performed by non-physicians in half of the studies and by physicians in the other half. The crude median (range) reported overall success rate was 0.969 (0.616–1.000). In random effects meta-analysis, the estimated overall intubation success rate was 0.953 (0.938–0.965). The crude median (range) reported intubation success rates for non-physicians were 0.917 (0.616–1.000) and, for physicians, were 0.988 (0.781–1.000) (p = 0.003).

Discussion
The reported overall success rate of pre-hospital intubation has improved, yet there is still a significant difference between non-physician and physician providers. The finding that less-experienced personnel perform less well is not unexpected, but since there is considerable evidence that poorly performed intubation carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality careful consideration should be given to the training and experience required to deliver this intervention safely.},
