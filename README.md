# SATIATED study
Soiled Airway Tracheal Intubation and the Effectiveness of Decontamination by Paramedics (SATIATED) study

## What is the SATIATED study?
SATIATED is a randomised trial which aims to determine whether paramedic first-pass intubation success of a simulated contaminated airway improves following training in Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination (SALAD).

## Can I replicate the data analysis?
Yes! I have provided the [raw data](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/data/SATIATED-Results%20-%20Sheet1.csv) and created a docker image which will enable you to recreate the environment I used to undertake the analysis. Just follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run Docker
3. Copy the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/master/Dockerfile) and place it into an empty folder
4. Open a terminal window (or Powershell in Windoze) and change the directory to match the folder that contains the Dockerfile
5. Enter the following command: `docker build ./`
6. This might take a while, but you should end with a comment like *Successfully built IMAGEID*
7. Run the command: `docker run --rm -p  8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=password IMAGEID` where IMAGEID is the IMAGEID value from step 6
8. Open a browser window and head to: *http://127.0.0.1:8787*. Log in with the username: rstudio and password: password, if asked
9. In the browser window, you should see an RStudio environment. ![RStudio](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/images/8-RStudio.png)
10. Scroll down to find the project file, called *r-satiated.Rproj* and click it. ![Open project](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/images/9-Open-the-project.png)
11. Now find the *Session* menu option along the top of the page and select *Restart R*. ![Restart R](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/images/10-Restart-R.png)
12. In the top-right hand window, click on the Build tab and then by clicking on the triangle next to the Build Book button, choose the *bookdown::pdf_book* option. ![Build book](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/images/11-Build-PDF.png)
13. Be patient, this might take a minute, but once completed a new window with the rendered PDF should appear. ![View PDF](https://github.com/RichardPilbery/r-satiated/raw/master/images/12-View-PDF.png)
