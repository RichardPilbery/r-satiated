# Introduction {#intro}

Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in out-hospital-cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a reported incidence of 20â€“30% [@benger_effect_2018; @voss_how_2014; @simons_incidence_2007]. This is of concern since patients who have suffered an OHCA, are already in extremis and there is limited evidence that the presence of emesis leads to a reduction in odds of survival [@simons_incidence_2007]. If standard suctioning techniques are not sufficient to maintain a clear airway and provide ventilation, then these patients will die, irrespective of the quality of chest compressions and the timeliness of defibrillation. Arguably, tracheal intubation is the preferred airway management technique in patients with ongoing airway contamination, but there is evidence that this is difficult to achieve when the airway is soiled [@sakles_impact_2017]. Early intubation may also help prevent aspiration pneumonias which are thought to adversely affect survival outcome, although this has yet to be proved empirically [@christ_early-onset_2016].

Traditional suctioning techniques have been criticised, and paramedic training in the management of contaminated airways, limited. This has led to the development of a combined suction/laryngoscopy technique to facilitate intubation, known as Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination (SALAD), and the creation of modified airway manikins to allow for practice in these techniques [@ducanto_novel_2017].

However, to date there has only been one study specifically looking at the SALAD technique and the outcomes were limited to self-reported confidence measures of trainees using the technique. Other techniques have been described to manage significant airway contamination, including the use of a meconium aspirator [@kei_comparing_2017], which requires a device that is not typically carried by UK ambulance services, and deliberate intubation of the oesophagus (the oesophageal diversion manoeuvre), of which the sum total of evidence in support of the procedure is a single case report [@kornhall_intentional_2015].

This study aimed to determine whether a short teaching session of the SALAD technique to paramedics, improved their ability to successfully intubate a contaminated airway. The primary objective was to determine the difference between paramedic first-pass intubation success, before and after SALAD training, in a simulated soiled airway. The secondary objective was to determine the difference in time taken to achieve first-pass intubation success, before and after SALAD training in a simulated soiled airway, since it was hypothesised that the time to successful intubation might improve as a result of repeated attempts at intubation i.e. be due to a practice effect, rather than the SALAD technique alone.
